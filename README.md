## ❯ Getting Started

### Step 1: Set up the Development Environment

You need to set up your development environment before you can do anything.

Install [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

- on OSX use [homebrew](http://brew.sh) `brew install node`
- on Windows use [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) `choco install nodejs`

Install yarn globally (Optional)

```bash
npm install yarn -g
```
Install all dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 2: Serve your App

Go to the project dir and start your app with this npm script.

```bash
npm run start
```

> This starts a local server using `nodemon`, which will watch for any file changes and will restart the sever according to these changes.
> The server address will be displayed to you as `http://localhost:3000`.
